Inspector
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE: Inspect function implemented.

DONE: onInspecting highlight element in HTML Tree behaviour implemented.
      When inspecting, the elements are being highlighted, and the scroll
      is being changed to make the element visible in the tree.

Core
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED: Problem with scope in event handlers. All functions that need to access
       the "shared scope" must be assigned to a local variable.
        
        var onClick = function onClick(e)
        {
        ...

FIXED: Revised "extend" and "append" functions

FIXED: problem with the new Firebug for FF3, it seems that it doesn't allow 
      extending the console namespace anymore.
            
FIXED: CommandLineAPI --> $, $$, dir, dirxml...

FIXED: Fixed bug in getLocation function, the relative path calculation wasn't 
       working in all cases. 

FIXED: Fixed bug in commandLine. Commands that doesn't return a value (if, for,
       while) wasn't being properly executed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Events
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED: Opera problem with the TAB key in commandLine

FIXED: Better handling of the F12 key press, which wasn't being properly
       attached to the Chrome Frame window.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chrome
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED: Problem with multiple iframes and the resizing of the Chrome, that
       tries to add events on them.

FIXED: Fixed problem in IE when resizing the Chrome, when the relative position
       of the mouse wasnt being computed in all frames of the document, 
       resulting in strange flickerings when resizing it.

FIXED: Fixed problem in Opera when resizing the Chrome.

FIXED: Problem when resizing with the fbVSplitter, when it reaches the side of
       the screen. Problem with negative pixel numbers.

FIXED: fbVSplitter is bigger than the frame in firefox. Problem with mouse scroll.

FIXED: isScrolledToBottom is not working in Firefox, it seems that this is 
      happening because the scrollable panel is some pixels higher than
      it should be.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inspector
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED: Selected element in HTML tree isn't being highlighted (boxmodel)

FIXED: BoxModel functions entirely revised. Now the position, size, padding
       and margin are being computed correctly, in all units: pt, px, em, ex
       and % (need to test more deeply the percentage values).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
commandLine
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED: better handling of scope of commandLine.eval(), if you type "this" it will
      refer to the CommandLine module, and it should refer to "window" instead
